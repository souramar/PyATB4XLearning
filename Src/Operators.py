# Operators

# used to perform action using operands, here 2 and 3 are operands


# Assignment operator = used to store value.
age = 65
print(age)

# Unary operator -
number_of_lambo = -1
print(number_of_lambo)

# Arithematic Operators  are x+y,x-y,x*y,x/y

print(2 + 3)
print(3 - 2)
print(2 * 3)
print(6 / 3)

# x//y, x==y, x%y, x**y

print(13 // 4)  # divison quotient will be printed
print(13 == 4)  # comparison value will be printed
print(2 ** 4)  # power will be printed
print(13 % 2)  # divison remainder will be printed

# is operator - will be used in loops and list


# Comparison/Logical operator are there  <,>,<=,=>,!=,==


x = 20
y = 40

print(x > y)  # False
print(x < y)  # True
print(x >= y)  # False

# Gates or, and, nor

# Ternary Operators - conditional
